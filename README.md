# Welcome to the Recipe App project repository!

In this project, I will be developing a recipe app using the latest features of the React ecosystem, including Hooks and Context API.

With this app, you will be able to:

View a wide variety of recipes for both food and drinks.
Search for specific recipes based on keywords or ingredients.
Filter recipes based on various categories such as cuisine type, dietary restrictions, and cooking time.
Favorite your preferred recipes and easily access them later.
Track the preparation progress of recipes.

⚠️ Please note that the recipe data will be sourced from two distinct APIs, one for food and another for drinks.

The app's layout is designed primarily for mobile devices, so all prototypes will be developed with smaller screens in mind.


# Recipe App

This is a recipe app developed using React.js. The app allows users to browse through a collection of recipes and explore various culinary delights. Users can search for specific recipes, filter recipes based on different categories, and save their favorite recipes for future reference.

The app's layout is designed primarily for mobile devices, so all prototypes will be developed with smaller screens in mind.

## Features

- **Recipe Search:** Users can search for specific recipes by entering keywords or ingredients. The app will provide relevant search results based on the user's query.
- **Recipe Filtering:** Users can filter recipes based on different categories such as cuisine type, etc. This makes it easier for users to find recipes that suit their preferences.
- **Recipe Details:** Each recipe page provides detailed information about the selected recipe, including ingredients, cooking instructions, and nutritional facts.
- **Favorite Recipes:** Users can save their favorite recipes by adding them to their personal collection. This feature allows users to easily access and revisit their preferred recipes.
- **User Authentication:** Users can create accounts and log in to the app. This enables them to save their preferences, favorite recipes, and access personalized features.
⚠️ Please note that the recipe data will be sourced from two distinct APIs, one for food and another for drinks.
